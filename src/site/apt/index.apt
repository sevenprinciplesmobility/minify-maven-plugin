Minify Maven Plugin

  This plugin combines and minimizes your CSS and JavaScript files for faster page loading. It produces a merged and a minified version of your CSS and JavaScript resources which can be re-used across your project.

  Under the hood, it uses the {{{http://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/}YUI Compressor}} and {{{https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/}Google Closure Compiler}} but has a layer of abstraction around these tools which allows for other tools to be added in the future.

* Goals Overview
